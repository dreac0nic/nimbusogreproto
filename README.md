"Nimbus" [WT] OGRE Prototype
============================

A brief prototype for the continuation of the "Nimbus" (working title) project, focusing on using OGRE to demonstrate the engine capabilities.

Will focus on implementation of:
 * Basic terrain generation
 * Lighting
 * Camera movement
 * Example gameplay mechanics.

###### NOTES
Currently does not include OGRE library files for the sake of repository integrity. May be included in a future version.
